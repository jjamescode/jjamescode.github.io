## My First Blog Post

![alt text](/images/first-post-250.png)

I'm learning so much these days and wanted an easy place to store my lessons. I hope to look back on this and either laugh at my early understandings or cry at my dream deferred. We shall see!

Currently I've been learning about DevOps in the hopes of seeing how everything works together. One of the downsides of working in a huge company is everything is siloed. This makes gaining clarity of the big picture harder when you don't understand how all the compnonents work together.  

So here's hoping I gain more and more knowledge to serve me now and in the future.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on projects that combine multiple displines into 1 project.

1. Linux
2. Docker
3. Terraform
4. AWS
5. Jenkins
6. Ansible

Wish me luck!
